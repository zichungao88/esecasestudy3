function [img, x, y] = rays2img(rays_x, rays_y, width, Npixels)
% rays2img - Simulates the operation of a camera sensor, where each pixel
% simply collects (i.e., counts) all of the rays that intersect it. The
% image sensor is assumed to be square with 100% fill factor (no dead
% areas) and 100% quantum efficiency (each ray intersecting the sensor is
% collected).
%
% inputs:
% rays_x: A 1 x N vector representing the x position of each ray in meters.
% rays_y: A 1 x N vector representing the y position of each ray in meters.
% width: A scalar that specifies the total width of the image sensor in 
%   meters.
% Npixels: A scalar that specifies the number of pixels along one side of 
%   the square image sensor.
%
% outputs:
% img: An Npixels x Npixels matrix representing a grayscale image captured 
%   by an image sensor with a total Npixels^2 pixels.
% x: A 1 x 2 vector that specifies the x positions of the left and right 
%   edges of the imaging sensor in meters.
% y: A 1 x 2 vector that specifies the y positions of the bottom and top 
%   edges of the imaging sensor in meters.

% eliminate rays that are off screen
onScreen = abs(rays_x) < width / 2 & abs(rays_y) < width / 2;
x_in = rays_x(onScreen);

% separate screen into pixels, calculate coordinates of each pixel's edges
mPerPx = width/Npixels;
Xedges = ((1:Npixels + 1) - (1 + Npixels + 1) / 2) * mPerPx;
Yedges = ((1:Npixels + 1) - (1 + Npixels + 1) / 2) * mPerPx;

% count rays at each pixel within the image
% histcounts2 for some reason assigns x to rows, y to columns
img = histcounts2(y_in, x_in, Yedges, Xedges);

% rescale img to uint8 dynamic range
img = uint8(round(img/max(img(:)) * 255));
